# Arch Linux Cheatsheet
This is my own Arch Linux install guide, in case my future self is too lazy to type out commands himself, or has untimely memory loss. \
For likely more clear and detailed instructions, please refer to the offical Arch Linux installation guide [here][guide]. 

#### Contents: 
* [Installation](install.md)
* [Network configurations](network.md)
* [Using AUR packages](aur.md)
